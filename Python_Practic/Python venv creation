To create a virtual environment, decide upon a directory where you want to place it, and run the venv module as a script with the directory path:

python -m venv tutorial-env


once youâ€™ve created a virtual environment, you may activate it.

On Windows, run:

tutorial-env\Scripts\activate
On Unix or MacOS, run:

source tutorial-env/bin/activate
