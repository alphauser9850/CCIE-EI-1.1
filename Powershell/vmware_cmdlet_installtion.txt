Check VMware PowerCLI Installation:

Ensure that you have VMware PowerCLI installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the VMware website1.

Make sure you’re using an elevated PowerShell session (Run as Administrator).

Verify Module Path:
Sometimes the module path is not automatically added to the PowerShell environment.

Run the following command to check if the module path is included:
$env:PSModulePath

If the path to the PowerCLI module directory is missing, you’ll need to add it manually.

Manually Add Module Path:
Locate the directory where VMware PowerCLI is installed. By default, it’s usually in C:\Program Files\VMware\Infrastructure\PowerCLI\Modules.

Add this path to your PowerShell module path:
$env:PSModulePath += ";C:\Program Files\VMware\Infrastructure\PowerCLI\Modules"

Try Importing Again:
Now try importing the module:
Import-Module VMware.PowerCLI

Verify Successful Import:
If successful, you should be able to use PowerCLI cmdlets without errors.

Enable Script Execution:

Enable Script Execution:
By default, PowerShell restricts script execution for security reasons. You need to change the execution policy to allow running scripts.
Open a PowerShell window as an administrator (Run as Administrator).
Check Current Execution Policy:
Run the following command to check the current execution policy:

Get-ExecutionPolicy

Set Execution Policy:
Choose an appropriate execution policy based on your security requirements:
To allow all scripts to run, use:

Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

To allow only signed scripts to run, use:

Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

Confirm the Change:
Confirm the change by typing Y and pressing Enter.




It looks like you’re encountering a common issue with the Connect-VIServer cmdlet where it refuses to connect due to an invalid server certificate. This can happen if the certificate is self-signed or not trusted by your system.

To resolve this, you can set the InvalidCertificateAction option to Ignore or Warn using the Set-PowerCLIConfiguration cmdlet. This will allow you to bypass the certificate check and connect to the server. Here’s how you can do it:



# To ignore the invalid certificate warning
Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -InvalidCertificateAction Ignore -Confirm:$false

# Then try connecting again
Connect-VIServer -Server $Server -User $User -Password $Password
